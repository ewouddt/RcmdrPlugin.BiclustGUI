## Submission Notes

* The rqubic package was moved to suggest and is now used conditionally.
* NOTE: Many packages are added to the search path due the nature of the package. Since it is a wrapper GUI, a lot of packages are used completely as well as the example data sets of these packages (e.g. only data sets of package in the Depends field are picked up by R Commander).
